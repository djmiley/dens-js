(based on [bl.ock #3887118](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887118#index.html) by Mike Bostock)

This example demonstrates how to render a simple scatter plot with data from the [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The chart is constructed from the following components:

 + The `d3.tsv` component is used to load a tab-separated data file.
 + A [cartesian chart](/components/chart/cartesian.html), with linear scales for x and y, is used to render the plot area, axes and labels.
 + A [point series](/components/series/point.html) is used to render the data, with the [decorate pattern](/components/introduction/decorate-pattern.html) used to colour each point.
 + The [decorate pattern](/components/introduction/decorate-pattern.html) is also used to add a legend (courtesy of the [d3-legend](http://d3-legend.susielu.com) project). In this case, the legend is inserted into the SVG via the enter selection, with [svg flexbox](/components/layout/layout.html) used for positioning.
